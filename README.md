# Wachtwoorden
Part of a group assignment

This program creates a list of 50 passwords.
The length of the passwords is specified by the user.
The passwords always include at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one symbol.

This program was incorporated into a larger data-encryption program that can be found at https://github.com/marnixnieswaag/Data_Encrypter
